In this lesson you will learn what a reproducible example is and how it can help you better understand your code and solve error messages and other issues that may arise.

1.  Minimal Reproducible Examples: what are they and why are they useful?
2.  Understanding your code: what is each line in my code actually doing?
3.  Debugging Basics: what do I do when I encounter an error?
4.  Minimal Reproducible Data: What data do I use? How do I create dummy data?
5.  Minimal Reproducible Code: Which parts of my code do I actually need to replicate?
6.  Asking Your Question: My code is ready, how do I ask my question?
