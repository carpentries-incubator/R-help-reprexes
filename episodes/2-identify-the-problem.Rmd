Let's take a look in more detail at the first step of the roadmap.

![](fig/01_identify_problem.png)

In this episode, we'll cover what to do when you first encounter an error or undesired output from your code. We'll cover the basics of identifying errors, fixing them if possible, and determining when to create a reprex. At the end of the lesson, we'll return to Mickey's analysis.

Let's start with some **code first aid** strategies--quick, first-line strategies that you might attempt as soon as you notice that something is wrong with your code. These steps might fix your problem or give you more insight into what the problem is... or they might not help you at all, in which case we'll talk about what to try next!

## Strategy 1: Interpret error messages and change function inputs

R will often let us know there's a problem by displaying an error message. An error that generates an error message is called a **syntax error**. Error messages happen when R is not able to run your code (this is in contrast to a **warning** message, which gives a hint that something could be wrong while the code keeps running). Error messages are sometimes straightforward, but other times they can be very tricky to decipher. In this lesson, will teach some tools for interpreting syntax errors for yourself.

First, let's look at an example error message.

```{r, error = T}
# Make a plot of the different taxa in the rodents dataset
ggplot(x = taxa) + geom_bar()
```

This code produces an error. What's going on?

We know from the previous episode that there's a column called `taxa` in our dataset! But R is telling us that it can't find `taxa` in the local environment. That's because we haven't told it where to look--recall that `taxa` is the name of a column in the surveys dataset. 

Let's try again, this time pointing ggplot to the `taxa` column of `surveys` using the `$` operator. 

We'll also fix another error that R *didn't* tell us was happening: we forgot to add `aes()` in order to tell ggplot that the `surveys$taxa` object is defining the x aesthetic of the plot.

```{r, error=T}
ggplot(aes(x = surveys$taxa)) + geom_bar()
```

It seems like that should have worked, but we got another error message, and this one seems even harder to interpret. How discouraging! But we can return to our previous strategy: let's go over each part of the error message and see if it provides any clues.

First, we see an error from a function called `fortify`, which we didn't even use! Then, there's a more helpful informational message: "Did you accidentally pass `aes()` to the `data` argument?" This does seem to relate to our line of code, as we do pass `aes` into the `ggplot` function. But what is this "`data` argument?"

## Strategy 2: Read function documentation

Sometimes, when an error message is hard to make sense of, it can help to check the documentation for the function that produced the error.

Let's access the documentation for the function `ggplot`: 

```{r}
?ggplot
```

A Help window pops up in RStudio. [Add discussion of the different sections of function documentation, in general terms, here?] The "Usage" and "Arguments" sections tell us that ggplot takes the argument `data`, followed by `mapping`, which uses `aes()`. The "Arguments" section tells us that if the object passed to that first `data` argument isn't already a data frame, ggplot will try to convert it to a data frame using `fortify`. That function, `fortify`, sounds familiar from the error message! This gives us an important clue. It looks like we accidentally passed the `mapping` argument into the position where ggplot expected `data` in the form of a data frame.

The "Examples" section of the function documentation can be particularly helpful because it shows how functions are used in context. The "Examples" section in the `ggplot` documentation, under "Pattern 1", shows exactly how `ggplot` expects the `data` and `mapping` arguments to be written.

Using this information, we can change our code to put the arguments in the right order--first the name of the dataset for the `data` argument, and then the `aes()` call for the `mapping` argument.

```{r}
ggplot(data = surveys, mapping = aes(x = taxa)) + geom_bar()
```

The error message is gone, and it works! Here we see our desired plot. What do you notice about the data?

*- Lots of rodents*
*- Some missing values (NAs)*

Let's take a moment to highlight some patterns we're starting to see in the course of tinkering with our code.

First, we **noticed a problem**. In this case, the problem was a *syntax error*, in which the code failed to run and we got an error message.

We carefully **read the error message** and took a guess at what might be wrong. We **changed the inputs to the function** accordingly and tried again.

When we encountered another error message, we **looked through the function documentation** to find more clues about how to fix the error. This helped us see that we were missing an argument.

Another strategy we could have tried would be to copy and paste the error message into a **search engine or a generative LLM** for more interpretable explanations. And, when all else fails, we can prepare our code into a reproducible example for expert help.

Let's see if we can use the strategies we've learned so far to address a new problem. Here they are, for reference:

### Exercise 1: Applying code first aid

Below we see an error message pop up when trying to quantify the counts of `genus` and `species` in our dataset. Which of the following interpretations of the error message most aptly describes the problem (hint: look at the `?tally` documentation if you're stuck!)

```{r, error=T}
surveys %>% tally(genus, species)
```

a.  `tally` does not accept `'type' (character)` arguments. We should change genus and species to factors or numbers and run this line again.

b.  `tally` does not accept `'type' (character)` arguments. There is no way to quantify these data with this function.

c.  `tally` does not accept `'type' (character)` arguments. We need to assign a weight (e.g. 1) to each row so it knows how much to numerically weigh each observation.

d.  `tally` does not accept `'type' (character)` arguments. This function is not intended to `group_by` two variables and a different function (`count`) is required instead.

::: solution
d is the correct answer!

```{r}
surveys %>% count(genus, species)

```
:::
::::

## Semantic errors

Let's go back to our rodent analysis. We would like to subset the data to include only the `Rodent` taxon (as opposed to the other taxa included in the dataset: Bird, Rabbit, Reptile or NA). Let's quickly check to see how much data we'd be throwing out by doing so:

```{r}
table(surveys$taxa)
```

We're interested in the rodents, and thankfully it seems like a majority of our observations will be maintained when subsetting to rodents. But wait... In the barplot above, we could clearly see that there were some NA values. Why don't we see them here? 

This is a new type of problem, called a **semantic error**: the R code ran without any error messages, but it produced an unexpected output. Because there is no error message, semantic errors can be sneaky and hard to notice!

We can't use our first code first aid strategy here, since there is no error message to read. So let's jump straight to strategy 2, **reading the function documentation.**

```{r}
?table
```

The documentation for `table` provides some clues. The "Usage" and "Arguments" sections show us an argument called `useNA` that accepts "no", "ifany", and "always", but it's not immediately apparent which one we should use to show our NA values. When we look at "Examples", we find something else that looks helpful:

``` r
table(a)                 # does not report NA's
table(a, exclude = NULL) # reports NA's
```

Aha! So it looks like we can use `exclude = NULL` to report NAs in our table. Let's try that.

```{r}
table(surveys$taxa, exclude = NULL)
```

Problem solved! Now the NA values show up in the table. We see that by subsetting to the "Rodent" taxa, we would losing about 357 NAs, which themselves could be rodents! However, in this case, it seems a small enough portion to safely omit. Let's subset our data to the rodent taxon.

```{r}
# Just rodents
rodents <- surveys %>% filter(taxa == "Rodent")
```

:::: challenge
### Exercise 2: Syntax vs. semantic errors

There are 3 lines of code below, and each attempts to create the same plot. Identify which produces a syntax error, which produces a semantic error, and which correctly creates the plot (hint: this may require you inferring what type of graph we're trying to create!)

A.  `ggplot(rodents) + geom_bin_2d(aes(month, plot_type))`

B.  `ggplot(rodents) + geom_tile(aes(month, plot_type), stat = "count")`

C.  `ggplot(rodents) + geom_tile(aes(month, plot_type))`

::: solution
In this case, A correctly creates the graph, plotting as colors in the tile the number of times an observation is seen. It essentially runs the following lines of code:

```{r}
rodents_summary <- rodents %>% group_by(plot_type, month) %>% summarize(count=n())
ggplot(rodents_summary) + geom_tile(aes(month, plot_type, fill=count))
```

B is a syntax error, and will produce the following error:

```{r, error=T}
ggplot(rodents) + geom_tile(aes(month, plot_type), stat = "count")
```

Finally, C is a semantic error. It does produce a plot, which is rather meaningless:

```{r}
ggplot(rodents) + geom_tile(aes(month, plot_type))
```

::::

The steps to identifying the problem and in **code first aid** matches what we've seen above. However, here seeing the problem arise in our code may be much more subtle, and comes from us recognizing output we don't expect or know to be wrong. Even if the code is run, R may give us **warning** or informational messages which pop up when executing your code. Most of the time, however, it's up to the coder to be vigilant and be sure steps are running as they should. Interpreting the problem may also be more difficult as R gives us little or no indication about how it's misinterpreting our intent.

::: callout
Generally, the more your code deviates from just using base R functions, or the more you use specific packages, both the quality of documentation and online help available from search engines and Googling gets worse and worse. While base R errors will often be solvable in a couple of minutes from a quick `?help` check or a long online discussion and solutions on a website like Stack Overflow, errors arising from little-used packages applied in bespoke analyses might merit isolating your specific problem to a reproducible example for online help, or even getting in touch with the developers! Such community input and questions are often the way packages and documentation improves over time.
:::

## Identifying the problem

In the previous section, it was evident which function was causing a syntax or semantic error. But sometimes, identifying the problem may be trickier. It may be difficult to determine which lines or sections of code are producing the error.

Let's take a look at another code example. Our goal: to see **which k-rat species appear in different plot types over the years**.

::: instructor
The misspelling of "Dipodomys" below is deliberate!
:::

```{r, error=T}
# Example: identifying a more complex error

# Just k-rats
krats <- rodents %>% filter(genus == "Dipadomys") #filter the dataset to just include the kangaroo rat genus

# plot a histogram of how many observations are seen in each plot type over an x axis of years.
ggplot(krats, aes(year, fill = plot_type)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~species)
```

Uh-oh. Another error here, when we try to make a ggplot. But what is "combine_vars?" And then: "Faceting variables must have at least one value" What does that mean?

This is not an easily interpretable error message from `ggplot`, and our code looks like it *should* run. This time we put the `data` argument in the right place, we included `aes()`, and we didn't misspell anything.

Considering this chunk of code, let's take a step back. Is it possible that we're looking at the wrong code? What if the error isn't in the ggplot code itself? Let's look at the `krats` dataset to make sure it looks normal.

```{r}
krats
```

It's empty! Something must have gone wrong not with `ggplot`, but with the code we used to create the `krats` object. 

## Strategy 4: Using `print()` to show information

We can use a `print` statement to see which genera are included in the original `rodents` dataset.

```{r}
print(rodents %>% count(genus))
```

This tells us two things. For one, we noticed that we have misspelled *Dipodomys*, which we can now fix.

Our `print()` call also tells us that we should expect a data frame with 9573 values after subsetting to the genus *Dipodomys*. This will be useful to check our work after fixing the misspelling.

```{r}
# Example: identifying a more complex error

# Just k-rats
krats <- rodents %>% filter(genus == "Dipodomys") #filter the dataset to just include the kangaroo rat genus (fixed misspelling)

# check dimensions of krats
dim(krats) # 9573, as expected!

# plot a histogram of how many observations are seen in each plot type over an x axis of years.
ggplot(krats, aes(year, fill = plot_type)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~species)
```

Our improved code here looks good. Checking the dimensions of our subsetted data frame using `dim()` function confirms we now have all the *Dipodomys* observations, and our plot is looking better. 

Routinely printing out information about your dataset can be a good way to check that your intermediate results make sense.

## Summary: Code first aid

Let's update our list of code first aid strategies:

::: callout
### Code first aid strategies, detailed version

0.  Identify the problem area

-   add print statements immediately upstream or downstream of problem areas
-   check the desired output from functions
-   see whether any intermediate output can be further isolated and examined separately

1.  Act on parts of the error we can understand

-   interpreting error messages
-   changing input to a function
-   checking on the control flow of code (e.g. for loops, if/else)

2.  Reading the R documentation for relevant functions

-   reading the documentation's **Description**, **Usage**, **Arguments**, **Details**
-   testing out code from the **Examples** section

3.  Quick online help with a search engine / generative LLM

-   Copying error messages for more interpretable explanations
-   Describing your error in the hopes of an already-solved solution
-   Seeing if an LLM generates equivalent error-free code solving the same goal
:::

We can now understand these steps as a continuous cycle of zeroing in on the problem more and more precisely. Whenever one of the first aid steps helps us identify a part of the code that is failing, we can zoom in on that piece of code and restart the checklist. 

If the first aid steps are enough to solve the problem, great! If not, we can stop trying once we get stuck or don't understand anymore how the code is failing. At that point, we can isolate the specific code area and use it to create a reprex in order to get help from someone else. **We'll delve more into the process of creating a reprex in the next episode.**

:::: challenge
### Exercise 3: Isolating the problem

The following lines of code are not working correctly. 

A. What type of error is this?
B. Using the toolbox of code first aid strategies, can you isolate the problem area?


```{r, error=T}
# Goal: run a chi square test to see whether kangaroo rat observations in the `control` plot type differ significantly between different plot_ids (hopefully not!)

control_plot_data <-  krats %>% filter(plot_type == "Control")

n_control_plots <- length(control_plot_data$plot_id)
exp_proportions <- rep(1/n_control_plots, n_control_plots)

plot_counts <- control_plot_data %>% group_by(plot_id) %>% summarize(n = n())

# Chisq test -- do count values vary significantly by plot id? 

chisq.test(plot_counts$n, p = exp_proportions)
```

::: solution
An isolated version of the problem area might look like:

```{r, error=T}
n_control_plots <- length(control_plot_data$plot_id)
exp_proportions <- rep(1/n_control_plots, n_control_plots)

# Chisq test -- do count values vary significantly by plot id? 

chisq.test(plot_counts$n, p = exp_proportions)
```

If we decide to move the plot_counts line right after the first control_plot_data line, as plot_counts seems to be calculated correctly. Here, we can see there's probably something wrong with the `p` argument: exp_proportions is very long, much longer than the number of control plots! Let's solve the problem.

```{r}
n_control_plots <- length(unique(control_plot_data$plot_id))
exp_proportions <- rep(1/n_control_plots, n_control_plots)

# Chisq test -- do count values vary significantly by plot id? 

chisq.test(plot_counts$n, p = exp_proportions)
```

We can see that some plots have significantly more or fewer counts than others! Observations of kangaroo rats are not random -- rather, some plots seem to attract the kangaroo rats more than others.

## When should I prepare my code for a reprex?

If you've isolated the problem area and tried using **code first aid** strategies, but the error persists, it may be time to get some help.

In a classroom setting, we may be used to raising our hand, pointing at our code, and saying "I'm not sure what's wrong." But outside of the classroom, helpers have limited time, bandwidth, and requisite knowledge to help. That's why reproducing the problem with a **reproducible example** is an essential skill to getting unstuck: it allows you to ask for expert help with a problem that's clearly identified, self-contained, and reproducible, and allows the expert to quickly see whether they've got the requisite skills to answer your question! 

## Back to our analysis: Mickey tries to get unstuck

Back in the lab, Mickey is happily coding along, exploring the data. Let's follow their analysis and see how they use code first aid and prepare the code for a reprex.

Mickey is interested in understanding how kangaroo rat weights differ across species and sexes, so they create a quick visualization.

```{r}
ggplot(rodents, aes(x = species, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Whoa, this is really overwhelming! Mickey forgot that the dataset includes data for a lot of different rodent species, not just kangaroo rats. Mickey is only interested in two kangaroo rat species: *Dipodomys ordii* (Ord's kangaroo rat) and *Dipodomys spectabilis* (Banner-tailed kangaroo rat).

Mickey also notices that there are three categories for sex: F, M, and what looks like a blank field when there is no sex information available. For the purposes of comparing weights, Mickey wants to focus only rodents of known sex.

Mickey filters the data to include only the two focal species and only rodents whose sex is F or M.

```{r}
rodents_subset <- rodents %>%
  filter(species == c("ordii", "spectabilis"),
         sex == c("F", "M"))
```

Because these scientific names are long, Mickey also decides to add common names to the dataset. They start by creating a data frame with the common names, which they will then join to the `rodents_subset` dataset:

```{r}
# Add common names
common_names <- data.frame(species = unique(rodents_subset$species), common_name = c("Ord's", "Banner-tailed"))
common_names
```

But looking at the `common names` dataset reveals a problem! The common names are not properly matched to the scientific names. For example, the genus *Ordii* should correspond to Ord's kangaroo rat, but currently, it is matched with the Banner-tailed kangaroo rat instead.

::: challenge
1.  Is this a syntax error or a semantic error? Explain why.
2.  What "code first aid" steps might be appropriate here? Which ones are unlikely to be helpful?
:::

Mickey re-orders the names and tries the code again. This time, it works! The common names are joined to the correct scientific names. Mickey joins the common names to `rodents_subset`.

```{r}
common_names <- data.frame(species = sort(unique(rodents_subset$species)), common_name = c("Ord's", "Banner-Tailed"))
rodents_subset <- left_join(rodents_subset, common_names, by = "species")
```

Now, Mickey is ready to start learning about kangaroo rat weights. They start by running a quick linear regression to predict `weight` based on `species` and `sex`.

```{r}
# Explore k-rat weights
weight_model <- lm(weight ~ common_name + sex, data = rodents_subset)
summary(weight_model) 
```

The negative coefficient for `common_nameOrd's` tells Mickey that Ord's kangaroo rats are significantly less heavy than Banner-tailed kangaroo rats.

But something is wrong with the coefficients for sex. Why are there NA values for `sexM`? Let's directly visualize weight by species and sex to see.

```{r}
rodents_subset %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = weight, x = common_name, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

When Mickey visualizes the data, they see a problem in the graph, too. As the model showed, Ord's kangaroo rats are significantly smaller than Banner-tailed kangaroo rats. But something is definitely wrong! Because the boxes are colored by sex, we can see that all of the Banner-tailed kangaroo rats are male and all of the Ord's kangaroo rats are female. That can't be right! What are the chances of catching all one sex for two different species?

To verify that the problem comes from the data, not from the plot code, Mickey creates a two-way frequency table, which confirms that there are no observations of female *spectabilis* or male *ordii* in `rodents_subset`. Something definitely seems wrong. Those rows should not be missing.

```{r}
# Subsetted dataset
table(rodents_subset$sex, rodents_subset$species)
```

To double check, Mickey looks at the original dataset.

```{r}
# Original dataset
table(rodents$sex, rodents$species)
```

Not only were there originally males and females present from both *ordii* and *spectabilis*, but the original numbers were way, way higher! It looks like somewhere along the way, Mickey lost a lot of observations.

While we don't have the time today, let's assume Mickey worked their way through the code first aid steps, but weren't able to solve the problem.

They decide to return to Remy's road map to figure out what to do next.

![](fig/Roadmap_Aug25.svg)

Since code first aid was not enough to solve this problem, it looks like it's time to ask for help using a *reprex*.

::: keypoints
-   The first step to getting unstuck is identifying a problem, isolating the problem area, and interpreting the problem
-   Often, using "code first aid" -- acting on error messages, looking at data, inputs, etc., pulling up documentation, asking a search engine or LLM, can help us to quickly fix the error on our own.
-   If code first aid doesn't work, we can ask for help and prepare a reproducible example (reprex) with a defined problem and isolated code
-   We'll cover future steps to prepare a reproducible example (reprex) in future episodes.
