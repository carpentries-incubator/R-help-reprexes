# explaining the columns that we'll be using

# Exploring data (visually) -----------------------------------------------

# Taxa barplot --> error, no data provided to ggplot2
ggplot(x = taxa) + geom_bar() # error
ggplot(aes(x = rodents$taxa)) + geom_bar() # error

ggplot(rodents, aes(x = taxa)) + geom_bar() # works. We notice the NAs here and we would like to remove them. How many are there?

# Check the breakdown of taxa
table(rodents$taxa) # notice that NAs don't show up in the table
?table
table(a)                 # does not report NA's
table(a, exclude = NULL) # reports NA's
table(rodents$taxa, exclude = NULL)

# filter to taxa == "Rodent" to include only the rodents
rodents <- rodents %>% filter(taxa == "Rodent")

# filter to k-rats only (genus == "Dipodomys")
krats <- rodents %>% filter(genus == "Dipydomis")
head(krats) # notice that this has 0 rows--we misspelled Dipodomys
krats <- rodents %>% filter(genus == "Dipodomys")
head(krats) # that's better
dim(krats)

# Can add or change any of these examples as needed for PL's lesson.

# Investigating by species and sex ----------------------------------------
# look at the distribution of observations by species and sex
krats %>% # option 1: stacked
  ggplot(aes(x = species, fill = sex))+
  geom_bar()

krats %>% # option 2: dodged
  ggplot(aes(x = species, fill = sex))+
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge())

# Ok, we have data for three k-rat species, and we're only interested in two of them. We also notice that we have NAs for both species and sex.
# Let's filter the data down to focus only on the species we care about and only on the sexes "M" and "F.
krats_subset <- krats %>%
  filter(species == c("ordii", "spectabilis"),
         sex == c("F", "M")) # XXX how do we deal with the fact that we get a warning message here? Need to bypass it somehow. Maybe even something like "you notice there's a warning, but someone told you that warnings aren't very important, so you move on."

# Another thing we noticed was that the species names are the latin names, and we would really like to provide some common names.
# We do some research, and we learn that the common name for ordii is "Ord's" and the common name for spectabilis is "Banner-Tailed" kangaroo rat.
common_names <- data.frame(species = unique(krats_subset$species), common_name = c("Ord's", "Banner-Tailed"))
common_names # oops, semantic error! these are in the wrong order.

sort(unique(krats_subset$species))
common_names <- data.frame(species = sort(unique(krats_subset$species)), common_name = c("Ord's", "Banner-Tailed"))
common_names # that's better. Now these line up correctly.

# attach the common names
krats_subset <- left_join(krats_subset, common_names)
unique(krats_subset$common_name) # yay!

# We know we're going to have to do some date manipulations later on, so let's make a date column
# XXX can insert another error in here if need be
krats_subset <- krats_subset %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(paste(year, month, day))) # correct code

# Model: weight by species and sex -------------------------------
# Now that you've done that data cleanup, you can finally move on to answering your research question, which is about weight.

weight_model <- lm(weight ~ species + sex, data = krats_subset)
summary(weight_model) # this looks weird! why are there NA's for sexM?
# Maybe we should visualize the data before we model it. Let's look at weight by species and sex.

krats_subset %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = weight, x = species, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() # umm, this is weird! We seem to have only females for ordii and only males for spectabilis. But we expect to have two sexes for both species. What's going on?

# This is a semantic error.
table(krats_subset$sex, krats_subset$species) # sure enough, we somehow ended up with only female ordii and only male spectabilis
table(krats$species, krats$sex) # here was the original breakdown of species and sex--removing NAs should not have removed that many! Why are we missing so many rows?
nrow(krats)
nrow(krats_subset) # we decreased our dataset by waaaaaay too much. Removed far too many rows.

# Here we move on to simplifying the data and the rest of the less --------
